# HW_CommentShapingFunctions_Leo

My porject does a mouse following ball.
There is a ball, and the ball's y position will alway follow the pathway's y position.
The ball's x position will follow mouse's x position all the time.
Thus, when the pathway become become more dense, the speed of the ball will increase automaticly.
